Perfect. Let’s create a clean, trendy landing page design inspired by fashion vibes and optimized for conversion. We’ll go for a mobile-first, scroll-based layout that works well on platforms like Framer, Webflow, or Carrd.

🎨 Overall Design Direction
Color Palette: Pastels (blush pink, lavender, soft beige) with high-contrast black or deep plum for accents

Typography: Elegant + modern serif for headlines (e.g., Playfair Display, DM Serif), clean sans-serif for body (e.g., Inter, Poppins)

Vibe: Soft, chic, stylish—but techy enough to feel like an AI product

CTA Buttons: Rounded corners, soft shadows, animated hover

Imagery: TikTok/Instagram style photos, AI-generated fashion collages, outfit grids

🖼️ Section-by-Section Breakdown (Wireframe Style)
Section 1: Hero (Above the Fold)
Layout: Split screen on desktop / stacked on mobile
